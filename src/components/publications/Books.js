        title="One Man is an Island: The Speech Community William Marsters Begat on Palmerston Island"

        content="Visitor's stories about Palmerston Island usually begin the same way. A sailor approaches the island, after several days at sea. The sky is blue and bright. The island lies low and green with palm trees. The white sand shines, as do the faces of the hospital Palmerston Islanders meeting the boat... This is all very well, and it was my experience too, but repeating it renders Palmerston Island an object of study viewed through the eyes of the outsider. While this perspective is the only one I can take, I would prefer to begin with Palmerston Islanders' own words to welcome you into their story, in particular, a poem by Mariana Powell, a Palmerston Islander by descent who grew up on Rarotonga, but speaking Palmerston English with her mother and sister. Mariana is one of the few people who regularly writes in Palmerston English, and she has devised her own spelling system to represent the sounds of the language."

        title="Relative Clauses in Time and Space: A case study in the methods of diachronic typology"
        citation="Hendery, R.. Relative Clauses in Time and Space: A Case Study in the Methods of Diachronic Typology. John Benjamins, 2012."
        url="https://doi.org/10.1075/tsl.101"
        content="This book presents a comprehensive survey of historically attested relative clause constructions from a diachronic typological perspective. Systematic integration of historical data and a typological approach demonstrates how typology and historical linguistics can each benefit from attention to the other. The diachronic behaviour of relative clauses is mapped across a broad range of genetically and geographically diverse languages. Central to the discussion is the strength of evidence for what have previously been claimed to be ‘natural’ or even ‘universal’ pathways of change. While many features of relative clause constructions are found to be remarkably stable over long periods of time, it is shown that language contact seems to be the crucial factor that does trigger change when it occurs. These results point to the importance of incorporating the effects of language contact into models of language change rather than viewing contact situations as exceptional. The findings of this study have implications for the definition of relative clauses, their syntactic structures and the relationships between the different ‘subtypes’ of this construction, as well as offering new directions for the integration of typological and historical linguistic research."

        citation="Hendery, R. & J. Hendriks. Grammatical Change: Theory and Description. Vol. 609. Pacific Linguistics, 2010."
        url=""
        content="This volume comprises a collection of papers on the theme of grammatical change that evolved out of a workshop sponsored by the Centre for Research on Language Change (The Australian National University). The papers extend the boundaries of what has been addressed under the label of ‘grammatical change’ by applying theories and models of grammatical change to new evidence; by illuminating the historical relationships between grammar and other levels of linguistics; and by extending the range of languages that have been examined from the perspective of grammatical change. Languages discussed include Murriny Patha, Walpiri, Gurindji, Walmajarri, and Kayardild, Lardil, Yukulta, English, Dutch, German, Afrikaans, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Slovenian, Albanian, Greek, Old Church Slavonic, Tocharian, Mandarin, Cantonese, Quechua, Basque, and Tok Pisin."
